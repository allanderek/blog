A few weeks ago I [wrote about an issue](/posts/empire-ai-water-usage/) in the book 'Empire of A.I.' by Karen Hao.
There is now a much more in-depth [look into this issue](https://andymasley.substack.com/p/empire-of-ai-is-wildly-misleading) by [Andy Masley](https://andymasley.substack.com/).

It includes a [response from the author](https://andymasley.substack.com/p/empire-of-ai-is-wildly-misleading/comment/178035060?utm_campaign=comment-list-share-cta&utm_medium=web&comments=true&commentId=178035060) and Andy's response to that response is well worth reading even if you don't read the main (very detailed) post.

I think both are writing in good faith here, it must be terrible to work on a book only to find you have published an error, which does seem to materially change a (fairly large) point you are making in your book. I do think Andy is correct though.
