            The purpose of Nitro was to bridge the gap between applications
            programming languages and the system programming languages that are
            used to provide the runtime services, such as automatic memory
            management, for these application languages. To do this Nitro allows
            the user to not only specify types but how those types are represented
            in memory. Because such memory representations are formally specified
            the type-checker can then ensure that they are used correctly.
            As part of my PhD I developed the language, specified formally in
            structural operational semantics, proved some useful properties that
            the language has, developed a stable compiler for the Nitro language,
            and used it to write some software such as a text editor which used
            the NCurses library directly without any need to marshal the native
            NCurses data types into a Nitro data type.</p></details></li><li><details class="summary-details"><summary>High-level problem solving research experience, dependent on the development of software for other users with complex requirements.</summary><p>I was involved in the <a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/pepa">PEPA research group.</a> PEPA is a language for expressing mathematical models of systems, which is used to
                investigate properties of many different kinds of systems from server-client systems,
                distributed systems, epidemiology processes, and the modelling of crowds. Bio-PEPA is
                a varient of PEPA particularly suitable for systems biology modelling. Users typically
                create a model of the system under investigation and then ask performance related queries
                such as: <i>What is the average number of waiting customers?</i> or <i>What is the probability that a request has been served within a given time constraint?</i></p></details></li><li>Developed several individual and team based software projects related
           to formal analysis of models written in a process algebra which were
           used by researchers from across the globe.</li><li><details class="summary-details"><summary>Ability to understand and improve existing software projects.</summary><p>I have taken over the development and/or joined the development
               team on several projects in a variety of programming languages, for example:<ul><li>I took on the development of the Imperial PEPA Compiler written in
                       Haskell and completely revamped the project such that it was
                       re-named the International PEPA compiler and published as library,
                       its source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/allanderek/ipclib">here.</a></li><li>I joined the development teams on both Eclipse plug-ins for
                       the PEPA and Bio-PEPA languages. These projects are written
                       Java and their related source code repositories can be found <a href="https://github.com/allanderek/pepa">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/allanderek/Bio-PEPA">here.</a></li><li>I joined the <a href="http://www.sbsi.ed.ac.uk/">SBSI</a> development team, mostly working on the SBSI-numerics component written in C++.</li></ul></p></details></li><li>An award-winning teacher with a diverse publication record of over 30

                    Our proposition was that the Pakk software would handle all aspects of a business looking to sell physical products online.
                    To that end our software provided the e-commerce store visited by customers as well as an admin panel for the businness owner and/or employees
                    to manage the store. Including (but not exhaustively), designing the look of the store, managing stock, promotions, loyalty schemes,
                    returns, customer service, purchase orders, and accounting. Because everything was integrated a store owner could for example know not just
                    how much stock of a particular product, but the booked value of that stock as well as the expected profit from selling all of that stock.
                      </p><p>My main role was a front-end software developer. Which means I was responsible for the front-end user interface of both the
                        customer facing e-commerce store and the merchant facing admin panel. Both significant, large and complex software projects.
                        Most of the front-end code was written in the functional programming language Elm. As such I have become an expert not just in Elm,
                        but specifically large Elm applications, and through the work on the admin panel, generalised software.
                        </p></div></details></li><li>2017-2019 Joined a startup with equity in the sports and gaming sector, looking to provide daily/weekly fantasy sports games.</li><li>2016-2017 Contracted software developer for an innovative start-up looking to disrupt the pre-employment background-screening and reference-checking services sector.</li><li>2015 Freelance software developer</li><li><details class="summary-details"><summary>2012—2015 LECTURER, SCHOOL OF INFORMATICS, THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH. </summary><div><p> I have lectured 4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate and Masters courses, Distributed Systems and Software Architecture, Process, and Management. Both courses had over 120 students however I engaged well with the students enough to win a Teaching Award for the feedback I gave to students. I have also taught two 3<sup>rd</sup> year undergraduate courses the Computer Science Large Practical and the Software Engineering Large Practical. Both are core courses for 3<sup>rd</sup> year students and involve lectures as well as the setting and grading of a substantial individual practical. In addition, I have tutored 1<sup>st</sup> year students learning to program in Haskell and Java. I have also supervised several students through their Masters or 4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate projects, guiding many to first class awards. </p><p> After my teaching award I was appointed as the feedback officer for the school of Informatics with the remit of improving the school's scores for feedback on student surveys, a remit that was achieved every year for which I was the school's feedback officer. </p><p> I was also tasked with the role of personal tutor for approximately 20 students each year. This role, is mostly a pastoral role guiding students through their studies but does involve exercising judgement in suggesting study directions/courses for students. </p><p> Alongside this I continued research as part of the PEPA group and in particular made contributions towards the QUANTICOL project including data collection, analysis and modelling of the City of Edinburgh's bus services. Developing almost exclusively in Python. </p></div></details></li><li><details class="summary-details"><summary>2010—2012 Post-Doctoral Researcher, School of Informatics/CSBE, the University of Edinburgh. </summary><p> Continued my role as a post-doctoral researcher but was now jointly affiliated with the School of Informatics and the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh (which is now a part of <a href="http://www.synthsys.ed.ac.uk/">SynthSys</a>). This has lead me both to focus more energy on biologically themed models (and their associated solution techniques) as well as become part of a development team for the <a href="http://www.sbsi.ed.ac.uk">SBSI</a> software. I was once again developing in Haskell, Python, and Java, but also maintaining legacy C code. </p></details></li><li><details class="summary-details"><summary>2006—2010 Post-Doctoral Researcher, School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh. </summary><p> I became a member of the PEPA modelling research group. PEPA is a language for modelling complex systems and reasoning about their performance (or timing) properties. My research involved developing new solution techniques and new methods to specify the model and importantly the queries of those models. As a part of this I wrote sofware to support these modelling innovations as well as collaborate with others to incorporate their new insights into my software. Developing mostly in Haskell, Java and Python. </p></details></li><li>2002—2006 Student Tutor, the University of Edinburgh.
